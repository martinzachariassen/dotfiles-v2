# `core/`

Phase 1. Same contract as a module, just first. Counts against the **engine**
budget. Keep `apply.sh` near-empty: core marks the phase boundary, it does not
collect special cases.

## Rules

- `core/Brewfile` installs `dasel` and `fzf`. **Nothing that runs before
  `brew bundle --file core/Brewfile` may use a tool listed in it.**
- A package belongs in `core/Brewfile` only if the machinery needs it or every
  machine must have it. It lists `bash`: one of the four bash-5 places.
- **The shim `~/.local/bin/dot` is generated, not symlinked.** Through a symlink
  `BASH_SOURCE` would point at `~/.local/bin`. `core/doctor.sh` and
  `uninstall.sh` both `grep -F` its exact `DOT_ROOT="<path>"` line.
- Doctor checks only what fails **silently**. "Is git installed" is not a check.
- Everything found must reach `DOT_FAILURES`. Never `|| true` on a doctor call.
- `dim`, not `warn`, for things true on every machine (uncommitted changes). A
  permanently yellow summary is the same bug as a permanently green one.
- Keep distinct causes distinct: shim missing vs. shim not executable.
  `uninstall.sh` tests `-f`, not `-x`: a shim that lost the bit is still ours.
